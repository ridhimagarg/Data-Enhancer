HomeAdvisor aims to connect homeowners with local service professionals to carry out home improvement, maintenance and remodeling projects. In April 2011, after rebranding, then-CEO Chris Terrill told StreetFight Magazine, “HomeAdvisor the only network for this type of on-demand service.” By 2015, HomeAdvisor had achieved more than $300 million in annual revenue, been used by more than 30 million homeowners, had nearly 100,000 employees in its network and almost 3 million verified reviews."
